## Project Description

The goal of the Typing Test project is to test the user and challenge their typing skills. 
The team will be making a typing application, which will give the user a trial containing a set of words they must type out.
If the user types in the wrong word prompt, the program will not allow the user to progress until the user has correctly typed the given word.
The program will also keep track of all the errors made by the user, and present stats of how well they did at the end of the test.

We are also looking at the option of a different mode, which displays the speed in which a user can type out a set of words.
In this mode, errors made by the user wont force them to finish the word, instead, they will move on try to complete the test as fast as they can.
At the end of the speed mode, the program will present stats on the users WPM(Words per minute) and error percentage.
If we get far enough, we are hoping to display stats and records accross other players as well,
potentially having users enter their initials to display in a leaderboard.

## Vision Statement

Our vision for this project is to achieve a feature-rich program with an elegant user interface. 
Because this project is a typing test, the team arranged what we thought were the best aspects from other online typing tests into the ultimate typing test program.
By using React, we will make use of modern web UX design principles and deploy it as a desktop application with the help of [Electron.](https://www.electronjs.org)
To manage the database, we plan to take advantage of AWS AmazonRDS to host MySQL.
